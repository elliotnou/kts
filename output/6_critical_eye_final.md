# Critical Eye (Final)

## FINAL CRITICAL EYE ASSESSMENT

After three revisions, this workflow finally gets the human judgment placement right. Here's my assessment:

### WELL-PLACED CHECKPOINTS ✓

**Step 2 (Strategic Framing)** - ESSENTIAL. This 5-minute human decision shapes everything downstream. AI cannot read the director's tone when they said "the board is... concerned" or catch that their emphasis on "quick wins" means they're politically vulnerable. Miss this framing, and your entire proposal solves the wrong problem beautifully.

**Step 5.5 (Scope Reality Check)** - BRILLIANT ADDITION. This catches the proposal-killer moments where you promise "increased ridership in 90 days" because the AI saw those words in the transcript. Three minutes to ask "Can we actually deliver this?" prevents the disasters that end consulting relationships. The specific examples of what NOT to promise as deliverables are spot-on.

**Step 7 (Final Review)** - APPROPRIATELY STREAMLINED. Five minutes to catch fatal flaws without perfectionist paralysis. The "trust your experience" guidance is crucial - experienced consultants can spot disasters quickly.

### REMAINING VULNERABILITY

**Step 4 Content Generation** still has some automation risk. When AI drafts methodology sections using "client data points," it might miss that their casual mention of "community pushback" actually signals major political complexity requiring specialized approaches. But given the 60-minute constraint, this is an acceptable trade-off.

### TECH STACK WISDOM

Brilliant decision to strip out brittle automation. Starting with manual Claude paste → Google Docs → Pandoc creates a workflow that actually works under pressure. Complex API chains would crater this timeline when they inevitably hiccup.

### MISSING ELEMENT (MINOR)

Consider a 30-second gut check after Step 6: "Does this proposal sound like it came from someone who was actually on those calls?" AI can be technically perfect but lose the conversational warmth that makes proposals feel personal.

### FINAL VERDICT

**This workflow is ready.** The two critical checkpoints - political reading and scope reality - are exactly where human disasters occur. Everything else is appropriately automated for speed while preserving the judgment that wins or loses transit consulting work.

The 55-minute target with 5-minute buffer shows realistic thinking. This will work in production.
