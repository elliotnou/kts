# Revised Workflow Plan: Lakeview Regional Transit Authority Proposal Development

**Integration Changes**: Based on Critical Eye feedback, I've added 3 mandatory human checkpoints for political sensitivity. Based on Toolsmith recommendations, I've specified exact tools and eliminated complex integrations for solo sustainability.

## Phase 1: Context Extraction & Client Intelligence (12 minutes)

**Step 1: Transcript Processing** (3 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: OpenAI GPT-4 API with custom prompt templates
- **Process**: Extract Patricia's exact language ("mind-numbing," "tell the story"), technical constraints (Trapeze 3-year lock, David's "basic Python"), political hot spots (Route 7 controversy, heated public meeting)
- **Output**: Structured JSON with pain points, technical specs, political sensitivities, budget parameters
- **Why this tool**: Best context retention across 3 long transcripts, reliable structured output

**Step 2: Political Risk Mapping** (4 minutes, human judgment - NEW CHECKPOINT)
- **Tool**: Google Sheets political sensitivity checklist
- **Critical human decision**: Patricia mentioned "very heated public meeting" about Route 7 cuts. Council members "think we should just cut routes that don't perform well." This isn't generic equity concern - it's her active battle. Must frame paratransit analysis as "strategic resource reallocation" NOT "cost reduction" (which validates council's cut-routes position)
- **Output**: Risk-assessed messaging framework avoiding political landmines
- **Cost of AI mistake**: Proposal sounds like we're validating council's "cut underperforming routes" stance, torpedoing Patricia's defensive position

**Step 3: Technical Reality Check** (3 minutes, human calibration - NEW CHECKPOINT)  
- **Tool**: Skills assessment matrix in Notion
- **Critical human decision**: David said "basic stuff in Python" + "haven't had time to use it." This is polite for "barely functional." Patricia complained TWICE about consultants leaving tools "nobody could replicate." Must dial back technical complexity significantly.
- **Output**: Recalibrated solution complexity matching actual (not stated) capabilities
- **Cost of AI mistake**: Repeat exact pattern Patricia complained about - sophisticated tools her team can't maintain

**Step 4: Client Language Bank** (2 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: GPT-4 API extracting client-specific terminology
- **Process**: Harvest conversational phrases for proposal personalization
- **Output**: Language bank for natural proposal tone matching Stephen's collaborative style

## Phase 2: Solution Architecture & Case Study Assembly (15 minutes)

**Step 5: Technical Solution Design** (6 minutes, human with AI assist)
- **Tool**: GPT-4 API with transit industry prompt library
- **Process**: Map Patricia's "four or five different places" data sources to simplified integration approach. Specify beginner-friendly Python tools with extensive documentation and training support
- **Human oversight**: Ensure solution complexity matches recalibrated technical assessment from Step 3
- **Output**: Technical methodology section with realistic complexity

**Step 6: Case Study Database Query** (4 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: Airtable API filtering case studies by agency size (50-100 buses), scope (data integration), geography (Ontario preferred)
- **Process**: Pull "three agencies in Ontario" examples Patricia specifically requested
- **Output**: Credibility-building case studies with similar constraints
- **Why Airtable**: Visual interface for maintaining case study database, API access for automation

**Step 7: Board Presentation Strategy** (3 minutes, human political navigation - NEW CHECKPOINT)
- **Critical human decision**: Patricia wants "work session" for "skeptical council members" who "respond better to questions." This isn't meeting format - it's political campaign. She's orchestrating opposition defusal before September vote. Must acknowledge political maneuvering without being explicit.
- **Tool**: Manual strategic planning using conversation context
- **Output**: Politically-aware engagement approach
- **Cost of AI mistake**: Generic "stakeholder engagement" misses that Patricia needs partners who understand the chess game

**Step 8: Pricing & Procurement Alignment** (2 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: Simple calculation matching $55-65K range to her $75K sole-source threshold
- **Process**: Structure three phases matching her "incremental progress" preference
- **Output**: Procurement-compliant pricing with phase gates

## Phase 3: Document Assembly & Personalization (25 minutes)

**Step 9: Template Population** (8 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: Google Docs API + Jinja2 templates in Python
- **Process**: Populate executive summary, methodology, deliverables, timeline sections using extracted context
- **Why Google Docs**: Patricia needs to "review with David" - collaborative editing essential for transit agencies
- **Output**: Draft proposal with client-specific content

**Step 10: Conversation Reference Integration** (7 minutes, automated with human spot-checks)
- **Tool**: GPT-4 API weaving specific conversation details throughout document
- **Process**: Include David's Excel pivot tables, Jamie's three-day schedule, 85 buses, 78% ridership recovery, quarterly state reporting, etc.
- **Human validation**: Ensure references are accurate and contextually appropriate
- **Output**: Highly personalized proposal proving conversation continuity

**Step 11: Political Messaging Refinement** (6 minutes, human)
- **Process**: Apply risk-assessed messaging from Step 2 throughout document
- **Focus areas**: Route 7 equity framing, paratransit as strategic reallocation, work session as collaboration opportunity
- **Tool**: Manual editing with political sensitivity checklist
- **Output**: Politically-calibrated proposal language

**Step 12: Sustainability Emphasis** (4 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: GPT-4 API emphasizing training approach, documentation, working sessions
- **Process**: Address Patricia's "consultants come and leave" concern throughout proposal
- **Output**: Sustainability-focused engagement description

## Phase 4: Quality Control & Professional Polish (8 minutes)

**Step 13: Grammar & Tone Check** (3 minutes, automated)
- **Tool**: Grammarly API for automated proofreading
- **Process**: Professional polish expected by public sector clients
- **Output**: Publication-ready document quality

**Step 14: Final Context Validation** (3 minutes, human)
- **Process**: Verify all conversation references accurate, technical solution matches capabilities, political framing supports Patricia's position
- **Tool**: Manual review against transcript excerpts
