# Workflow Plan: Lakeview Regional Transit Authority Proposal Development

Based on these transcripts, here's a 60-minute workflow specifically designed for Patricia's context, technical constraints, and political sensitivities:

## Phase 1: Context Extraction & Framing (12 minutes)

**Step 1: Pain Point Mapping** (5 minutes, automated)
- AI extracts specific operational challenges: David's 2-day monthly reports, 25% time on compliance, manual APC data cleaning
- Identifies political hot buttons: Route 7/medical center controversy, council split on route cuts
- Tags budget constraints: $75K sole-source threshold, $12M operating budget, staff limitations

**Step 2: Client Language Bank** (4 minutes, automated)  
- Harvests Patricia's exact phrases: "tell the story," "mind-numbing," "we've had consultants deliver 200-page reports and leave"
- Captures technical specifics: Trapeze contract (3 years), APC on 40% of fleet, GTFS vendor relationship
- Builds personalization database: David's Python skills, Jamie's GIS background, part-time constraints

**Step 3: Proposal Structure Selection** (3 minutes, human judgment)
- Choose phased approach matching Patricia's "incremental progress" preference
- Confirm September 18th timeline with mid-point work session for skeptical council members
- Validate $55-65K range against her stated $80K budget approval

## Phase 2: Technical Solution Mapping (15 minutes)

**Step 4: Data Integration Specification** (7 minutes, human with AI assist)
- Map Patricia's "four or five different places" data sources to integration approach
- Specify Python-based solution matching David's skill level ("basic stuff in Python")
- Design automated quality checks addressing APC data cleaning pain point

**Step 5: Political Narrative Development** (8 minutes, human judgment critical)
- Frame equity analysis around Route 7 example and "200 seniors can't get to medical center"
- Position paratransit analysis as cost reduction opportunity (Patricia's "great point" reaction)
- Structure board presentation approach for "council members who are skeptical"

## Phase 3: Credibility Assembly (8 minutes)

**Step 6: Case Study Selection** (5 minutes, automated with human validation)
- Pull "three agencies in Ontario in the 50-to-100 bus range" examples
- Match similar constraints: limited staff, data integration challenges, board skepticism
- Avoid over-technical examples that don't match David/Jamie's capacity

**Step 7: Team Positioning** (3 minutes, human)
- Emphasize working session approach: "David and Jamie would be involved in the analysis process"
- Highlight sustainability focus addressing her "consultants come and leave" concern
- Position technical complexity appropriately for their skill levels

## Phase 4: Document Assembly & Polish (20 minutes)

**Step 8: Executive Summary** (6 minutes, AI with human review)
- Open with Patricia's core challenge: "making evidence-based route adjustments" without $400K O-D study
- Frame around board pressure and council skepticism using her language
- Present three-phase solution matching her procurement and timeline needs

**Step 9: Technical Sections** (8 minutes, automated with spot checks)
- Populate methodology using conversation context (GTFS feeds, APC integration, census overlay)
- Detail deliverables with specific formats (dashboard for David, presentation for board)
- Specify training approach with working sessions and documentation

**Step 10: Final Personalization Pass** (6 minutes, human)
- Weave in conversation references: David's Excel pivot tables, Jamie's three-day schedule
- Include operational specifics: 85 buses, 78% ridership recovery, quarterly state reporting
- Add political context: heated public meeting, mayor support vs. council split

## Phase 5: Quality Control & Delivery (5 minutes)

**Step 11: Context Validation** (3 minutes, human)
- Verify all conversation references are accurate and contextually appropriate  
- Confirm technical solution matches their stated capabilities and constraints
- Check political framing aligns with Patricia's narrative needs

**Step 12: Final Review & Send** (2 minutes, human)
- Proofread for agency-specific terminology and proper names
- Ensure proposal tone matches Stephen's collaborative, practical approach from calls
- Format professionally and deliver with timeline for Patricia's review with David

## Critical Human Judgment Points

**Political Sensitivity**: The Route 7 controversy and council dynamics require careful framing - AI can't assess political risk
**Technical Appropriateness**: Matching solution complexity to David's "basic Python" skills and Jamie's part-time availability
**Procurement Navigation**: Understanding public sector constraints and Patricia's $75K threshold strategy

## Success Metrics for This Client

- Patricia says "this feels like you really listened" (conversation continuity)
- David can envision using the proposed tools (technical fit)  
- Board presentation approach addresses her council member concerns (political alignment)
- Timeline and budget reflect her operational constraints (practical feasibility)

This workflow specifically addresses Lakeview's data fragmentation, staff limitations, political dynamics, and Patricia's emphasis on sustainable solutions. The 60-minute timeline is achievable because the conversation transcripts provide rich context that eliminates guesswork about client priorities and constraints.
