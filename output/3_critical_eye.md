# Critical Eye

Looking at these transcripts, I see THREE critical moments where automation alone would torpedo this proposal for Patricia:

## Checkpoint 1: Political Risk Assessment (Step 5, 4-minute human intervention)

**Why human judgment is essential**: Patricia mentioned a "very heated public meeting" about Route 7 cuts and council members who "think we should just cut routes that don't perform well." The AI will see "equity analysis" and "paratransit cost reduction" as generic selling points. A human recognizes these are POLITICAL LANDMINES.

**What AI will miss**: The Route 7 example isn't just about seniors getting to medical centers - it's Patricia's actual battle with her council. The "200 seniors" isn't a hypothetical - it's her lived reality. AI won't grasp that positioning this as "cost reduction" could backfire if council members think she's admitting routes are wasteful. A human frames it as "strategic resource reallocation" instead.

**Cost of AI mistake**: Patricia loses credibility with her board if the proposal sounds like it's validating the council's "cut underperforming routes" position. This kills the entire engagement before it starts.

**Human decision time**: 4 minutes to reframe the paratransit analysis and equity messaging to support Patricia's defensive position, not undermine it.

## Checkpoint 2: Technical Solution Calibration (Step 4, 3-minute reality check)

**Why human judgment matters**: David said he "can do basic stuff in Python" but "hasn't had time to use it." Jamie has GIS skills but is part-time. AI will propose a reasonable Python-based solution. A human catches that David is being polite - "basic stuff" plus "no time to use it" equals "barely functional."

**What AI misses**: The gap between what someone CAN do and what they can SUSTAIN. Patricia explicitly said previous consultants "deliver a 200-page report and leave" with tools "nobody on staff could replicate." AI won't recognize that David's hesitant tone about Python suggests he needs MUCH simpler tools than initially proposed.

**Cost of AI mistake**: We repeat the exact pattern Patricia complained about - delivering sophisticated tools her team can't maintain. She mentions this concern TWICE in the transcripts. Getting it wrong proves we weren't listening.

**Human decision time**: 3 minutes to dial back technical complexity and add more hand-holding in the training phase.

## Checkpoint 3: Board Presentation Strategy (Step 10, 2-minute political navigation)

**Why human intervention is critical**: Patricia wants a "work session" with "council members who are skeptical" because they "respond better when they can ask questions." She also needs to "socialize findings with council members who are on the fence" before the formal September board meeting.

**What AI will miss**: This isn't just about meeting format - Patricia is orchestrating a political campaign. The skeptical council members aren't just asking technical questions; they're looking for ammunition to cut routes. The "work session" is Patricia's strategy to defuse opposition before the formal vote. AI will propose generic "stakeholder engagement" without understanding the chess game.

**Cost of AI mistake**: The proposal suggests we don't understand her political constraints. If we can't read the political dynamics from the transcripts, how can we navigate the actual engagement? Patricia needs partners who get the politics, not just the analysis.

**Human decision time**: 2 minutes to adjust language around the work session and interim reporting to acknowledge the political maneuvering involved.

These three checkpoints are where human pattern recognition about organizational dynamics, technical capacity, and political context becomes irreplaceable. AI optimizes for logical solutions; humans recognize that Patricia's challenges are fundamentally about managing relationships, not just analyzing data. Miss these nuances, and we sound like every other consultant who "delivers reports and leaves."

The rest can be automated because the transcripts provide clear technical requirements, budget parameters, and timeline constraints. But these three moments require reading between the lines about what Patricia REALLY needs to succeed in her environment.
